"Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Applications to Computer Science"

The book is by Philip N. Klein of Brown University (website:http://codingthematrix.com/ & ISBN:9780615856735). This book focuses on learning and applying linear algebra with respect to programming, specifically Python. The book suggests that the student reading the text is adept in programming (in a CompSci program or taught themselves programming) and has a basic understanding of math and probabilities.

This is my first time using this book and I am hoping to learn the applications of linear algebra for future endeavors in bioinformatics. I will be uploading my notes from the text. These notes will be reflective of the topics discussed in the book but with my interpretation. I have two goals. First, I aim to share notes that are digestable. The second, is to push my programming abilities. You will see that I use my own terminology. I will include a disclaimer when I do. I will ask that if you think am over simplifying or misrepresenting something, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!! Because I may use different terms or present incomplete review of certain sections, it is important for you to learn on your own. In the spirit of Donna Meagle and Tom Havaford from Parks and Rec "Teach Yo' Self!".
